## 3. Consider Personal Meaning or Character Traits

When selecting a name, think about personal traits you want to convey. You can choose characters that reflect qualities you value or aspirations you have for yourself. For example, if you are strong-willed, consider names that include "强" (qiáng - strong) or "毅" (yì - resolute).

### Things to Consider:

- **Pronunciation**: Ensure the name sounds pleasant and is easy to pronounce.
- **Meaning**: Each character in a name carries meaning, so choose characters that reflect positive traits or aspirations.
- **Cultural Relevance**: Understand the cultural significance behind names, as some characters may have specific associations or connotations.

By using these methods, you can find a Chinese name that resonates with your identity and culture. Good luck!
